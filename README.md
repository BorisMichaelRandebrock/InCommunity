# Description
**InCommunity** is a smart contract-based platform that allows for decentralized decision-making and organization. Members can create proposals and vote on them to determine the immediate future.
The app is created as the perfect solution to improve governance for **participatory budgets for Town Halls**. 

It is a sustainable, cooperative, and collaborative tool designed for the development of the **Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)**. 

InCommunity can be scaled to other types of communities such as neighbours, companies, and shareholder meetings.

With InCommunity, **citizens** no longer need to physically attend meetings, saving time, fuel, and money on unnecessary travel. 

**You can have a voice in the votes that matter to you even during your well-deserved holidays.**

**Blockchain** technology allows citizens to participate in decision-making processes that previously required physical presence by **certifying** their **identity securely and transparently.**
# Features

Ability to create and vote on proposals

Decentralized decision-making

Transparent and secure process

# Bulletpoints

- We chose Aragon for the creation of our DAO because of its simplicity, security, and abundant options.
- We utilize the Polygon network due to its lower gas fees compared to other networks, and in some cases, it is feeless.
- InCommunity manages polling, proposals, minutes, and presentations for community members.
- The platform provides the flexibility to customize ballots according to specific needs.

# Future features

- Integration of the KYC (Know Your Customer)  to ensure the trustability and authentication for the voting process.
- Incorporation of streaming platforms like Zoom, Google Meet, Skype, and Teams to enable proactive participation of community members.
- Further development to transform InCommunity into a Progressive Web App (PWA) with offline capabilities..

The aim of these features is to enhance the user experience, increase community engagement, and provide a reliable and secure platform for decentralized, participatory decision-making.
